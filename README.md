# 🌲 SilvIA: AI for Forest Ecosystem Intelligence

SilvIA (from *Silva*, “forest” in Latin, and *IA* for *Inteligencia Artificial*) is a technical initiative to build an advanced, AI-powered system for **real-time monitoring, assessment, and prediction** of forest ecosystem health.  

By integrating **satellite remote sensing**, **meteorological data**, and **machine learning models**, SilvIA provides scalable tools for sustainable forest management, biodiversity conservation, and climate resilience.

## 🚀 Executive Summary
SilvIA combines state-of-the-art AI models to:
- Automate forest inventory mapping.  
- Detect degradation and reforestation zones.  
- Forecast wildfire risks.  
- Provide actionable insights for governments, NGOs, researchers, and local communities.  

---

## 📊 Technical Objectives
- Land cover classification using semantic segmentation.  
- Biomass and vegetation index estimation (NDVI, NBR, EVI, SAVI, etc.).  
- Detection of spatial and temporal degradation (illegal logging, desertification).  
- Wildfire risk forecasting using environmental and topographic variables.  
- Scalable **API** and **interactive dashboard** for end users.  

---

## 🛰️ Data Sources
- **Sentinel-2**: 13-band multispectral, 5-day revisit.  
- **MODIS**: NDVI/EVI composites & thermal bands.  
- **ERA5 / NOAA**: Meteorological reanalysis datasets.  
- **SRTM / DEM**: Terrain & slope data.  
- Optional: Lidar, drone imagery, in-situ inventories.  

---

## 🧠 AI Modeling Framework
- **Classification**: Deep CNNs (U-Net, DeepLabV3+) for land cover.  
- **Change Detection**: Siamese networks / Transformer-based time series.  
- **Prediction**: Fire risk (XGBoost, LSTM hybrids), degradation forecasting.  
- **Uncertainty Estimation**: Bayesian inference, Monte Carlo dropout.  

---

## 🛠️ System Architecture
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI), PostgreSQL/PostGIS.  
- **AI/ML Ops**: PyTorch Lightning, MLflow.  
- **Frontend**: React.js + Mapbox GL / Leaflet.js.  
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes on GCP/AWS.  
- **Data Access**: Google Earth Engine, AWS Open Data, STAC APIs.  

---

## 📍 MVP (3–4 months)
- Land cover classification (3–4 categories).  
- Monthly vegetation and risk maps.  
- Fire/degradation scoring overlays.  
- Interactive dashboard with timeline filters.  
- REST API for integration.  

---

## 🔮 Roadmap
1. MVP & pilot validation.  
2. Multi-biome expansion + real-time weather integration.  
3. Mobile app with alerts & photo feedback.  
4. Partnerships with institutions (B2B/B2G).  
5. Monetization: licensing, subscriptions, or freemium model.  

---

## 👥 Potential Collaborators
- Environmental ministries & forestry departments.  
- Wildfire prevention & emergency units.  
- NGOs on deforestation/restoration.  
- Research institutes in remote sensing & climate science.  
- Carbon offset & forestry firms.
